TopHat is an offline-first personal finances app. It lets users manage their finances across multiple currencies, in a privacy preserving way.

All data is stored in IndexedDB, so the app is completely available offline. It can optionally use some selected cloud services - AlphaVantage for exchange rates, and Dropbox for backup file storage.
